Data Dictionary (Model Export Column Definitions)

Column, Definition 
susceptible, The number of people who could potentially be infected by the disease. On day zero this population is simply the total population less the number of initial infections; each day thereafter it is the number of people who have never been exposed. 
asymptomatic, Cases where a person is infected but they show no symptoms. They can however infect other people. 
infected, Mild illnesses; infections where the person is showing mild symptoms but is not severe enough to need additional care. These people can infect others.
hospitalized, Severe illnesses; infections that have progressed to the point of needing hospital care. These people do not infect others.
icu, Critical illesses; patients that have been moved to ICU care. These people do not infect others.
recovered, People who have recovered from the disease and are now immunne. They cannot be re-infected.
fatalities, People who have passed away from the disease. 
r_0, The post-intervention R_0 value; this value will change immediately after an intervention. 
total symptomatic, The total number of symptomatic infections; mild + severe + critical. 
total infected, The total number of infections; this is the total symptomatic infections plus the number of asymptomatic infections.
